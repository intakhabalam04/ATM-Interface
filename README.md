# ATM Interface

The ATM Interface is a console-based application that simulates an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. It allows users to perform banking operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, transferring funds, checking transaction history, and viewing the account balance.

## How to Run

To run the ATM Interface on your system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download and install the latest JDK from the Oracle website: [Java SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

4. Compile the Java source files using the following command:

### javac Main.java

Run the compiled program using the following command:

### java Main

The ATM Interface will start running in the console. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

## Usage
Once the program is running, you will be prompted to enter a User ID and PIN for authentication. Use the provided User IDs and PINs from the sample data or modify the code to include your own user accounts.

After successful authentication, you will see the ATM menu with the following options:

Show Transaction History: Displays the transaction history for the logged-in account, including withdrawal, deposit, and transfer transactions.

Withdraw: Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount of money from their account.

Deposit: Allows the user to deposit a specified amount of money into their account.

Transfer: Enables the user to transfer funds from their account to another specified account.

Show Balance: Displays the current account balance.

Quit: Terminates the program and displays a thank you message.

Choose the desired option by entering the corresponding number and follow any additional prompts as necessary.
